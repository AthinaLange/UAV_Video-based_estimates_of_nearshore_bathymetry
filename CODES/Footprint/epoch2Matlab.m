function dnum = epoch2Matlab( epoch )

% Usage:
%
%    dnum = epoch2Matlab( epoch )
%
%   convert a UNIX epoch time as used in the Argus system into a Matlab
%   datenum. You can convert the datenum to whatever you want.
%
%   WARNING: DANGER: UNIX epoch times are all GMT based, and the datenum
%   returned from this routine is GMT. 
%

% get reference time
unixEpoch = datenum( 1970, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0 );

% how much later than reference time is input?
offset = double(epoch) / (24*3600);

% add and return
dnum = unixEpoch + offset;
